# CNN on Custom Images of Cats and Dogs
This project demonstrates how to train a CNN from scratch using a custom dataset of cats and dogs. It’s designed as a code-along exercise to show how to handle your own data — from organizing directories and applying transformations, to training, validating, and testing a model built in PyTorch.
